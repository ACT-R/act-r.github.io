        <h2> What is ACT-R?</h2>
        <p>
          ACT-R is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_architecture">
          cognitive architecture</a>, an extremely powerful
          computer model for developing and testing theories of cognitive
          behavior on a variety of tasks. Developed by
          researchers at <a href="http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/about/">
          Carnegie Mellon University</a>, ACT-R is based on
          <a href="http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/publication/">hundreds of
          psychological studies and papers</a>, and can provably
          emulate human performance in both task time and accuracy.

          Because of this, ACT-R is an incredible research and educational
          tool, allowing cognitive scientists to rapidly iterate on hypotheses
          of behavior.
        </p>

        <h2> What is ACT-R Lemonade Stand?</h2>
        <p>
          Because of the complexity of the ACT-R Architecture, it is difficult
          to explain to a non-user how ACT-R can be applied to
          psychological research.  Inspired by tools
          tools like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">MIT's Scratch Project</a>,
          ACT-R Lemonade Stand provides a hands-on introduction to the concepts
          of ACT-R through visual programming.  It presents students with a
          simple example, the <a href="#game">
          Lemonade Stand Game</a>, and teaches them to develop
          a series of models capable of improved performance on the task.

        <h1 class="uk-heading-divider">The Game</h1>
        <p>
          The Lemonade Stand Game is a commonly-used teaching tool for
          elementary school mathematics.  There are many implementations of the
          game (<a href="http://www.primarygames.com/socstudies/sim-lemonade-millionaire/">
          Lemonade Millionaire</a>, for example), but all tend to have a similar
          game cycle:
        </p>

        <ul class="uk-list" style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>
              <b> Inventory View </b><br>
              The user is shown a screen listing the quantity of lemonade
              ingredients (Lemons, Sugar, Ice and Cups) in their inventory, as
              well as their score (usually a dollar amount).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Weather View </b><br>
              The user is then shown a screen with a weather forecast, which
              is predictive of the number of customers willing to buy
              lemonade during that particular game cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Purchase Option </b><br>
              The user is given the option to purchase each of the inventory
              items (Lemons, Sugar, Ice and Cups) for a certain cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> End-Of-Day View </b><br>
              Once the user has selected the option to purchase items, the day
              begins.  The game simulates the number of cups of lemonade sold,
              and the cycle repeats.
            </li>
        </ul>

      <p>
        While it naively might seem like an optimal strategy to buy the maximum
        quantity of ingredients, the ingredients each have a probability of being
        lost- ice melts at the end of each day, and lemons and sugar spoil with
        some small probability. Thus, a good player must learn to purchase the
        items in the appropriate ratio, and in just the right quantity to
        “scrape by” for the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Lemonade Stand Game is a particularly good case study
        for teaching ACT-R because there are a number of models, increasing in
        complexity, which can be used to introduce students to the basic features
        of ACT-R.  To do this, a Javascript implementation of the game was implemented
        with the following game dynamics:
      </p>

      <ul class="uk-list" style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 40px;">
          <li>
            <b> Inventory View </b><br>
            The user is shown a screen listing the quantity of lemonade
            ingredients (Lemons, Sugar, Ice and Cups) in their inventory, as
            well as their score (usually a dollar amount).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Weather View </b><br>
            The user is then shown a screen with a weather forecast, which
            is predictive of the number of customers willing to buy
            lemonade during that particular game cycle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Purchase Option </b><br>
            The user is given the option to purchase each of the inventory
            items (Lemons, Sugar, Ice and Cups) for a certain cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> End-Of-Day View </b><br>
            Once the user has selected the option to purchase items, the day
            begins.  The game simulates the number of cups of lemonade sold,
            and the cycle repeats.
          </li>
      </ul>
